## Overview
A content-based movie recommendation system built using Python, NLP, and machine learning, which suggests movies similar to the user’s input based on genres, cast, crew, and movie descriptions.

## Features
- Content-Based Filtering – Uses movie metadata (overview, genres, cast, crew) for recommendations.
- TF-IDF Vectorization & Cosine Similarity – Computes similarity between movies.
- Efficient Preprocessing – Data cleaning, handling missing values, and text vectorization.

Tech Stack
-  Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
-  Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)
-  Streamlit (for Web UI)
-  TMDb Movie Dataset

## How It Works
-  The system processes the dataset of movies to extract relevant features such as genres, descriptions, or keywords.
-  A similarity matrix is generated using cosine similarity.
-  Based on the movie selected by the user, the system retrieves and ranks the most similar movies.
-  The top 5 movies are displayed as recommendations.
