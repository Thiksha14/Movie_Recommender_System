## Overview
A content-based movie recommendation system built using Python, NLP, and machine learning, which suggests movies similar to the userâ€™s input based on genres, cast, crew, and movie descriptions.

## Features
ğŸ”¹Content-Based Filtering â€“ Uses movie metadata (overview, genres, cast, crew) for recommendations.
ğŸ”¹TF-IDF Vectorization & Cosine Similarity â€“ Computes similarity between movies.
ğŸ”¹Efficient Preprocessing â€“ Data cleaning, handling missing values, and text vectorization.

Tech Stack
ğŸ”¹ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
ğŸ”¹ Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)
ğŸ”¹ Streamlit (for Web UI)
ğŸ”¹ TMDb Movie Dataset

## How It Works
ğŸ”¹ The system processes the dataset of movies to extract relevant features such as genres, descriptions, or keywords.
ğŸ”¹ A similarity matrix is generated using cosine similarity.
ğŸ”¹ Based on the movie selected by the user, the system retrieves and ranks the most similar movies.
ğŸ”¹ The top 5 movies are displayed as recommendations.
